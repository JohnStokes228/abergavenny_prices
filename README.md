some kind of spatial model most likely a GAM. Allowing me to get back into spatial data manipulation and especially to get more time hands on with geopandas package as other than using it briefly or choropleth maps ive not really touched it. the plan is to use the whole local area not sure where we'll find our limits.

current progress:
    - brought those two datasets together
    - setup initial analysis dashboard with basically 0 features
    - added some data shape info to dashboard
    - added a properties over time scatter plot to dashboard
    - added some info on proximity to supermarkets
    - constructed voronoi tessellations around various centroids
Up next:
    - add further data validation graphs to dashboard
    - add additional page to dashboard for analysis rather than validation purposes
    - maybe a third page for models?
    - figure out how to add ID to voronoi polygons
    - consider how to build a krigging model too, and then i guess figure out how to plot it.
